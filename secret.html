          &emsp; There will be more soon. You will get it soon, but at a price. Solve the puzzles, get the pieces, and find the secrets.
          I can't tell you when these puzzles will be posted, so keep an eye on the site. 
          Complete the puzzles, and you will earn your prize. Check this page for hints. 
          Once a riddle is solved, it should appear on the other pages. The hunt has not quite begun.
