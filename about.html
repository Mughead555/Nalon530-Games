        <h2>I am a one man team working on games for fun. I make various games and put a lot of effort into them. 
            I am not a good modeler and suck at drawing, but I plan on learning both skills, along with sound design. Check out the other pages for more info!
            Please do not spam pointless comments on the itch pages, and any assets that aren't mine belong to their original owners</h2>
