        <h2>&emsp; Future Projects and Ideas:</h2>
        <h3>Five Nights At Cubey's Demo</h3>
        <p>
            This is the next project i will work on after FNAC Beta V2 and will include night 2 and various other things. 
            After this release i plan on remaking the entire game from scratch due to the code being a mess and various other reasons.
