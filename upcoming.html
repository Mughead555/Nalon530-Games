        <h2>&emsp; Current Projects I Am Working On:</h2>
        <h3>&emsp; Five Nights At Cubey's Beta V2</h3>
        <p>
            &emsp; Five Nights At Cubey's Beta V2 will be a updated version of the original beta with bugfixes, balancing, new models, and more!
            For more information check out this post: <a href="https://nalon530.itch.io/five-nights-at-cubeys-beta/devlog/1084827/beta-v2-coming-soon">Beta V2 Itch Devlog</a>

        <h2>&emsp; Future Big Projects:</h2>
        <h3>&emsp; Five Nights At Cubey's Demo</h3>
        <p>
            &emsp; This is the next project i will work on after FNAC Beta V2 and will include night 2 and various other things. 
            After this release i plan on remaking the entire game from scratch due to the code being a mess and various other reasons.
        </p>
        <h3>&emsp; Five Nights at Freddy's Fan Game Full Version</h3>
        <p>
            &emsp; This will be the full version of FNAC with a new name, fully modeled animatronics, 6 nights, post-night tasks, and so much more!
            This will be my biggest game yet and i will release demos and updates on the project as i work on it.
        </p>
        <h2>&emsp; Ideas and Side Projects</h2>
        <h3>&emsp; Unnamed Platformer</h3>
        <p>
            &emsp; I currently haven't started work on this game and have no name for it yet.
            The idea for it is that it is a platformer, but your controls get randomised every set amount of time.
            It also may have some trolls in it as well, and will probably be very challenging.
